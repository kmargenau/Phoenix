# Phoenix

Phoenix is a project I just started recently and plan to build the most on

It will be a very random project and have zero meaning, but I will be implenting full course materials like HTML/CSS/JavaScript and other material as I learn my course.

Each and every tab will have its own theme and a mix of random prompts within. Some pages with have just HTML some will have HTML/CSS some with Javascript some with all, there really is no telling at this point its just going to go how I feel. 

So far we have implented just HTML/CSS using BootStrap 4 and taking different fonts and icons from google fonts and fontawesome.com.
